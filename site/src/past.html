            <h2>Mendoza in Papua New Guinea!</h2>
            <p class="text-section">
                The story of <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZAA!</span> starts in Papua New Guinea. Mendoza did not
                have access to internet therefore had very little knowledge of
                technology. His first few experiences in computer science was from
                his aunt in Australia who he used to visit a lot who was a front-end
                web developer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                Without the proper education or experience in IT he was a bit hopeless.
            </p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Mendoza in Australia</h2>
            <p class="text-section">
                Moving to australia in 2016 Mendoza finally got access to a computer.
                He was very interested by it often downloading random things off the
                internet.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                Still never had much experience in programming.
            </p>

            <h2>Mendoza in High School</h2>
            <p class="text-section">
                The story of <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZA!</span> and programming in high school began when he
                had
                to pick his year 11 elective subjects. He chose software design and
                development on an off chance for no particular reason. He failed
                every other subject except this subject.
            </p>
            <p class=" text-section">
                This is where <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZA!</span> got his start in many things, such as first
                learning python, then javascript+html, moving on to C#, then
                eventually golang and haskell. His formitive growth was here, making
                a lot of friends, one who introduced him to linux as a hobby.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                Now mendoza uses vim as his main text editor and doesn't have to lift
                his hands off his keyboard (he doesn't have to use a mouse) in order
                to operate his computer due to using a tiling window manager called
                xmonad.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZAA</span> had many difficult assignments during
                highschool. He had his first experience using databases with postgres and sqlite, he
                had his experiences using winforms with C# as a hangman game, and doing Object Oriented
                Programming. Then he went on to move towards C++. His final assignment was a full-stack
                website using graphql, golang, typescript and react.

            <h2>Mendoza at Macquarie University</h2>
            <p class="text-section">
                When <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZAA</span> graduated highschool, he didn't get a very good ATAR
                probably because of his lack of effort. Hence, All of his friend's from highschool
                moved to UTS and he was stuck alone at Macquarie University.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                The teachers and student's at Macquarie Uni were very nice, it was here
                Mendoza first started looking at graphics programming,
                and where he started using rust as his primary programming language. He joined the google
                developer club and started exploring functional programming and system administration more.
                One of his lecturer's ran a weekly soccer game, and that was fun.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZAAS</span> discrete maths lecturer used to use Haskell
                all the time during the lesson, and thus intrigued him. He sucked at Maths up until
                university but left him at a cross roads. Currently studying science, he wasn't liking his
                degree. He was left wondering whether to go to UTS with his friends and do computer science,
                or whether to change his major to maths from computing, and then do a double degree in information
                systems as well. He eventually chose to go to UTS.

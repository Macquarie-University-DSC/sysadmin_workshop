            <h1>Reflection about my overall design</h1>
            <p class="text-section">
                At first I was not too sure what my webpage should look like, I wasn't too confident about
                the colour choices and ended up making them variables so I would only have to change one
                value every time I changed the colours. I know I wanted a light colour scheme and ended up choosing
                blue.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                Designing the layout to the site wasn't that complicated as I mostly had everything in one streamline
                value. The hardest part was making the navbar and have it work relative to the section content. 
                In the end I found it was much easier to wrap everything in a &lt;main&gt; tag.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                Probably couldv'e made the website responsive or I could've added more graphical elements then just
                text.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section-pop">
            <h1>Technical aspects of my webpage</h1>
            <p class="text-section">
                The webpage is build in the structure of having a nav component
                then a sections then a footer. The nav component is wrapped around
                a &lt;nav&gt; tag to make it clear that it is indeed a nav component. The
                section components use the &lt;section&gt; tags to seperate each section,
                and are wrapped around a &lt;main&gt; tag in order to facilitate
                styling of the them. The footer is also in a &lt;section&gt; tag
                and is also wrapped inside the &lt;main&gt; tag. Also used the
                idea of alternating sections, that you would have main sections
                and b-sections that contrast. Put the styling for the b-sections
                in a class called '.section-pop' which had black text on white
                background compared to white text on a blue background. The other
                thing I did was I made it so the layout took up the entirety of 
                the screen rather then having a big gap around it. In otherwords
                I set margin to 0 for most of my classes except main to make space
                for the navbar.
            </p>

            <img src="static/images/layout.JPG" alt="Layout visual">
            
            <h3>Navbar</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                For the navbar the plan was to do the most stock standard
                navbar ever. I copied the generic layout of a bootstrap navbar
                by having a logo that points to the root of the webpage. Then,
                I had a few links to #about, past.html, future.html, and this
                page.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                The navbar is made up of a unordered list, anchor tags and a 
                nav tag. The navbar uses css flexbox to quickly align the items
                in a row or column. The website currently uses nowrap so it isn't
                functional on smaller screen unfortunately. I used relative
                padding "em" and gave each link a wide padding (spacing) on the left and right
                but smaller padding on the top and the bottom for a more slender
                navbar look.
            </p>

            <h3>Sections</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                First I wrapped everything in a &lt;main&gt; tag as described before.
                The main reason I used this, was to make everything into a flexbox
                in order to align item in the center of the page, and
                to move everything down a little to make room for the navbar. I
                originally was going to use css-grid to manage the sections and
                align them in the center, but since css-grid operates in two
                dimensions and flexbox uses one dimension, and flexbox has a much
                wider support for legacy browsers I opted to use flexbox instead.
                The reason it made little difference is my site is a 1-dimensional
                site containing no sidebars, or columns.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                Using the idea of seperating sections I created a class called
                '.section-pop' which had just an alternative colour scheme but was
                exactly the same in every other aspect.
            </p>

            <h3>Graphics and Images</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                Most of the graphics I used were either png for graphics or JPEG
                for compressed images. I mostly used the lowest quality possible.
                I used 'object-fit: cover;' for displaying most images in order
                to make sure they fit within a certain range without being heavily
                manipulated or stretched. I used a relative metric such as percentages
                for the width of screens, but at the same time I used a fixed metric of
                pixels in powers of 2 in order to decide the height for the best
                aesthetic.
            </p>

            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                I tried to do nothing fancy with the text. I set the font-families
                to 'Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif' based on the recommended web-safe
                fonts on the mdn. I increased the font size a little to '1.2em' in
                order for easier viewing without being too verbose. I also created
                a span that changes the texts-color to an accent color in order to
                highlight text, using the class '.mendoza-emphasis' which I used
                to highlight <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZZA!</span>
                whenever it came up. I also set the width of text sections to a
                fixed width of 1200px using the aptly named '.text-section' class.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Webpage aesthetics</h1>
            <p class="text-section">
                Overall I probably should've included more graphics, but my site
                as it is, is mostly centered around text. For the main site I used
                a colour pallete of around 6 colours. I also tried to make the
                webpage have lot's of contrasting elements. I planned originally
                to make the index or home page be mostly graphics and the opposite
                for the other sections.
            </p>

            <h3>Overall layout</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                I opted for a more streamline design, where all the items are a
                single column. I used no margins on the divs so that the colour
                would span the entire screen. Everything is ordered from top to
                bottom.
            </p>

            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                Even though the home page is vastly different from the other pages
                with a major focus on graphics and less text, it's structure is
                still overall the same. Having images that act as a menu to 
                highlight certain webpages on the home screen is a very common
                element of most web pages so I used that concept. I also wanted
                to have a fairly basic banner on top. But beneath that the structure
                is exactly the same.
            </p>
            <img src="static/images/home-layout.png" alt="home-layout">
            
            <h3>Colours</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                For colours I used a simple colour scheme of 6 colours, one colour
                for the ui components such as navbars and such, one colour for
                highlighted text, one colour for the main background and one colour
                for the main text colour, one colour for the subsection background,
                and one colour for subtext background. I really prefer lighter
                backgrounds, and so always wanted to avoid dark colours. I opted
                to use a mostly blue background since it was the only colour theme
                that worked without looking tacky or without needing to include
                fancy graphical elements. I used off whites or plain whites to
                have a subtle difference or contrast between the colours you can
                barely see. I used orange as a highlight colour since it contrasts
                well with a blue pallet.
            </p>

            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                With text I wanted it to be centered and padded for easier viewing.
                I tried not to write massive paragraphs so the content would be much
                more digestable and easier to read. I also chose to use sans-serif
                fonts since they are generally accepted as the best font's to use on
                browsers.
            </p>

            <h3>User interaction and engagement</h3>
            <p class="text-section">
                The overall goal of the site was to make it very easily digestable
                to users. I wanted users to be able to read and perceive the page
                without having to think too much. The goal was to be simple and 
                not to overwhelm the user. The site had to be easily accessible
                through the navigation bar, and it had to be very clear what each
                section was about. Hence the addition of many titles, tables of contents
                and such.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section-pop">
            <h1>Webpage accessibility</h1>
            <p class="text-section">
                With the webpage I made sure to use contrasting colours such as
                black on white, and white on a darker blue. I also used elements
                such as alt texts for images in order to make sure they were accesible
                to screen readers. While I included some graphics, I also made sure
                everything was explained through text for that purpose as well. The
                website had minimal interaction and really the only interactive elements
                were scrolling, and clicking links. As such it should not be too difficult
                for users who have impaired motor skills to access the site.

            <p class="text-section">
                Generally speaking, <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZZAAA!</span> is
                not entirely sure what he want's to do after Uni. He has multiple
                options and multiple choices of what he can do though. It is most
                likely that he will try get a job as a full-stack web developer.
                Although he might try apply for any system administrator jobs, or
                backend functional programming jobs available. Or he could
                possibly go back to uni and do some stuff related to mathematics
                and programming languages. He could even go back to uni and do
                data science.

            <h2>What does MENDOZA want to get out of university?</h2>
            <p class="text-section">
                Young <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZAA</span> wants to
                acquire new skills and such things. Especially in terms of interaction
                design and graphics. He want's to get better at things he isn't
                very good at. On top of that he also want's to learn about things
                that he find's very interesting.

                Coming from a family of web developers, old mate has a strong
                foundation in that area. Doing a degree in computer science
                majoring in enterprise systems, he hopes he will do well with
                his future knowledge.

            <h2>Mendoza and Functional Programming</h2>
            <p class="text-section">
                <span class="mendoza-emphasis">MENDOZZAAA!</span> definately
                plans to expand his experience in functional programming. Whether
                it be through web development, or going back to uni another time.
            </p>
            <p class="text-section">
                He would like to possibly get a job as a F# developer, or clojure
                dev. He would also be super happy if there was any rust or Haskell
                jobs available but sadly they seem pretty non-existant.
